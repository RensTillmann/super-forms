<p>
	There are tons of settings available within Super Forms.<br />
	There are 3 types of settings:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Default settings (the default form settings found under <strong>Super Forms > Settings</strong>)</li>
	<li>Form Settings (form specific settings found under <strong>Form Settings</strong> when editing a form)</li>
	<li>Element Settings (these are settings related to an element)</li>
</ul>
<p>
	It is important to understand that the default settings will not affect any existing forms that you have created.<br />
	You will have to adjust these on form level (on the builder page when editing the form).<br />
	If needed you can always export the default settings and import it into the form if required.<br />
	You can do this via <strong>Super Forms > Settings > Export & Import</strong> by copying the settings code and importing it on the builder page via <strong>Form Settings > Export & Import</strong>
