Hi there!<br /><br />

Below I will talk a little about myself and Super Forms. If you want to skip this I recommand you to read the <a href="#doc-2">Getting Started</a> section on this page. This should help you with the most important things regarding Super Forms and how it works.
</p>

<p>
My name is Rens, I was born in the Netherlands on 1992. I started programming at the age of 14 and have been programming every day since, or at least almost every day since ;)<p>

<p>
All the things I have learned in the past years I have put it my plugin (concept) called Super Forms. My vision regarding Super Forms is much bigger than just a Form builder for WordPress. I have learned one important thing as a webdeveloper which is that in general every application is based on a form that a user has to submit. Without this you would have to create database queries to update/add/delete data. What I am trying to say here is that with a form the possibilities are endless. My goal is to deliver all the possibilities that you can do with a single form through Super Forms for WordPress users without the need to do any programming. To be completely honest with you, I am a very lazy guy and since I have to create different forms every single time for new projects I thought, I have to make something that I can use to speed things up. At that moment Super Forms was born!

<p>
Now you know a little bit about me and my vision for Super Forms we should start talking about all it's features so you can start creating the form you need. The documentation should be able to provide you with the basic knowledge that is required to start creating and publishing your forms on your WordPress website. I have tried my best to make the documentation as simple as possible with a live search functionallity that should help you to find what you need within seconds. Over time this documentation will grow along with updates and new features.
