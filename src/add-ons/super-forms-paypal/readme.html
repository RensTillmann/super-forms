		<h3 id="step-1"><strong>Step 1 - Installation / Activation of plugin</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>Make sure you have installed and activated the plugin. If you do not know how to do this please <a href="http://f4d.nl/super-forms/knowledge-base-article/upload-install/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">watch the tutorial video</a>.</p>
		
		<hr>

		<h3 id="step-2"><strong>Step 2 - Enabling paypal checkout</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>
			After you have installed the add-on successfully you can go to <strong>Super Forms &gt; Create Form </strong>(or edit an existing form of your choosing).
			Click on "Form Settings" TAB on the right hand side to open up the Settings panel.
			From the dropdown menu choose "PayPal Checkout" (this will open all the settings related to the PayPal checkout process).
			Make sure to Enable the PayPal Checkout by clicking "Enable PayPal Checkout" (see picture below):
		</p>
		<img src="assets/readme/images/settings1.png" />

		<p>
			Because you will be creating your first PayPal Checkout form we advise you to enable the PayPal Sandbox mode.
			This is useful because now you can test as many times as you wish without making real transactions with real money.
			Instead you will be using your PayPal sandbox account. If you do not have one already please head over to <a href="http://sandbox.paypal.com">sandbox.paypal.com</a> and create your first sandbox account.
			To enable the sandbox mode you can simply click on "Enable PayPal Sandbox mode (for testing purposes only)" as you can see in the below picture:
		</p>
		<img src="assets/readme/images/enable-sandbox.png" />

		<hr>

		<h3 id="step-3"><strong>Step 3 - Adding merchant email to receive payments</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>
			Once you completed step 1 and 2 above, you can now go ahead and enter the PayPal merchant email.
			This will in most cases be your own paypal email address account where you wish to receive payments on.
			In some cases you might have a form that requires to dynamically retrieve the email address based on user selected information.
			In that case you can use {tags} to retrieve this data.
			For now just enter your sandbox email address (see picture below):
		</p>
		<img src="assets/readme/images/merchant-email.png" />

		<hr>

		<h3 id="step-4"><strong>Step 4 - Choosing your currency</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>
			The next important thing to change accordingly is the currency for the PayPal checkouts.
			Depending on your country you can change this to for instance USD ($), EUR (€) or any other currency supported by PayPal.
		</p>
		<img src="assets/readme/images/currency.png" />

		<hr>

		<h3 id="step-5"><strong>Step 5 - Shipping address requirement setting</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>
			Normally when a user checkouts out via PayPal you would ask for an address. But because you might already have the address of the user (filled out in the form) you could let the user skip to enter their shipping address. There are 3 options you can choose from. The most common one tho choose would normally be the default value, but you can change it to any of the following if required:
		</p>
		<img src="assets/readme/images/shipping-address.png" />
		
		<hr>

		<h3 id="step-6"><strong>Step 6 - Choosing the payment method</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>
			In order to be able to checkout with PayPal, PayPal must know what type of payment it is that you are doing. The add-on allows you to handle 4 different payment methods.
			Depending on your needs you can choose one of the following payment methods:
		</p>
		<img src="assets/readme/images/payment-method.png" />
		<p>Each payment method is explained here:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><a href="#step-6-1">6.1 - Single product or service checkout</a></li>
			<li><a href="#step-6-2">6.2 - Donation checkout</a></li>
			<li><a href="#step-6-3">6.3 - Subscription checkout</a></li>
			<li><a href="#step-6-4">6.4 - Cart checkout (for multiple product checkout)</a></li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			<strong><em><a href="#step-7">If you do not want information about each payment method you can click here to skip to Step 7</a></em></strong>
		</p>

		<hr>

		<h3 id="step-6.1"><strong>6.1 - Single product or service checkout</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>
			This method is meant for only 1 product checkouts.
			When using this payment method you will only have to set the <strong>Item description</strong> (this will be your product name).
			The <strong>Item description</strong> option is compatible with {tags} so you can dynamically set this based on user selected options in your form.
			Of course your product has a price, which you can set under <strong>Item price</strong> (must be float number e.g: 12.59)
			The<strong> Item price</strong> option is also compatible with {tags} so you can also dynamically set the price based on user selected options in your form.
			The last requirement is the <strong>Quantity</strong> to be added to the PayPal checkout basket (must be a numeric value).
			Below you can see all the settings with example values that you could enter:
		</p>
		<img src="assets/readme/images/item-name-price-quantity.png" />
		
		<hr>
		
		<h3 id="step-6.2"><strong>6.2 - Donation checkout</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>
			The Donation checkout method is only used for... (you guessed it) donations.
			A donation checkout requires the same options as the <strong>Single product or service checkout</strong> method with the exception that there is no <strong>Quantity</strong> option available for this method.
		</p>

		<hr>

		<h3 id="step-6.3"><strong>6.3 - Subscription checkout</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>
			The Subscription checkout method is only used when you wish to create a new subscription for the user who filled out the form.
			When selected you will be prompted to choose the <strong>Item description</strong> just like you would with the<strong> Single product</strong> and <strong>Donation</strong> checkout methods.
			The most important difference the Subscription checkout has is it's option to set <strong>Subscription periods</strong>
			Here you will be able to adjust the time frame regarding the subscription. A subscription may also have a trial period and a second trial period.
			The Subscription periods option is compatible with {tags} so you can dynamically create subscription time periods based on user selected options in your form.
			Please refer to the below examples to fully understand how to set it up for your own use cases:
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Use case 1:</strong><br />
			<em>You want to create a subscription without a trial period that costs $20.50 p/m:</em>
		</p>
		<img src="assets/readme/images/subscription-periods-usecase1.png" />
		
		<hr>

		<p>
			<strong>Use case 2:</strong><br />
			<em>You want to create a subscription with 1 trial period for 3 days and after trial period is over $2 per week:</em>
		</p>
		<img src="assets/readme/images/subscription-periods-usecase2.png" />
		
		<hr>

		<p>
			<strong>Use case 3:</strong><br />
			<em>You want to create a subscription with 2 trial periods (1st 1 week trial), 2nd (2 weeks for $3 p/w), after that $18 p/m:</em>
		</p>
		<img src="assets/readme/images/subscription-periods-usecase3.png" />

		<hr>

		<h3 id="step-6.4"><strong>6.4 - Cart checkout (for multiple product checkout)</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>
			he Cart checkout will only be used and required whenever you need or want to send users to the PayPal checkout where they will checkout multiple products at once.
			In other words, it will function as a shopping bag/cart just like with a regular webshop.
			To add multiple items to the PayPal checkout you have to enter each item under the <strong>Items to be added to cart</strong> option.
			Each item can contain the following variables:<br />
			<strong>{price}|{quantity}|{item_name}</strong>|{tax}|{shipping}|{shipping2}|{discount_amount}|{discount_rate}<br />
			In most use cases you will only be using the first 3 to 4 options.
			To fully understand how PayPal handles these variables please read the <a href="https://developer.paypal.com/docs/classic/paypal-payments-standard/integration-guide/Appx_websitestandard_htmlvariables/#individual-items-variables" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PayPal's Variable Reference</a>
			Please refer to the below examples to fully understand how to set it up for your own use cases:
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Use case 1:</strong><br />
			<em>You want to add 2 products to the paypal cart (5x Flowers $3.49) and (3x Towels $7.25):</em>
		</p>
		<img src="assets/readme/images/cart-checkout-usecase1.png" />
		
		<hr>

		<p>
			<strong>Use case 2:</strong><br />
			<em>Based on user selected option you want to dynamically return the price for a fixed product and the user selected quantity:</em>
		</p>
		<img src="assets/readme/images/cart-checkout-usecase2.png" />
		
		<hr>
		
		<p>
			<strong>Use case 3:</strong><br />
			<em>Let's say you have a dynamic column setup with super forms with inside quantity element, dropdown for product name, and a variable field that is updated based on the dropdown option.
			You will have multiple products depending on how many times the user would add a new set of fields by clicking the + button on the dynamic column.
			You will be able to simply enter the following {tags} and Super Forms - PayPal add-on will automatically add all the available options to the PayPal checkout.</em>
		</p>
		<img src="assets/readme/images/cart-checkout-usecase3.png" />

		<hr>

		<h3 id="step-7"><strong>Step 7 - Setting up return URL</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>
			After you finished all the above steps and choosen your desired payment method for your checkout, you can now setup a proper return URL.
			This is the URL where a user will be redirect to after the user successfully returns from paypal. This can be any URL of your choosing.
			By default it will be http://yourdomain.com/?page=super_paypal_response
			PayPal will post information about the transaction in the form of Instant Payment Notification messages.
			This can optionally be used by the developer to display any data regarding the payment on the page.<br />
			<em>Make sure you properly change this to your own needs before going live.</em>
		</p>
		
		<hr>

		<h3 id="step-8"><strong>Step 8 - Setting up cancel URL</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>
			This URL will be used to redirect the user back to your website after they canceled the checkout process on PayPal checkout page.
			User that cancels payment will be redirected to this URL. This can be any URL of your choosing, but by default it will be: http://yourdomain.com/my-custom-canceled-page<br />
			<em>Make sure you properly change this to your own needs before going live.</em>
		</p>
		<img src="assets/readme/images/cancel-url.png" />

		<hr>

		<h3 id="step-9"><strong>Step 9 - Testing with sandbox account before going live</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>
			The last step is to test your form functioning before going live.
			Use your PayPal sandbox account to simulate payments and various form submissions.
			If you have created an advanced form with Super Forms, try to test as many of the possible variations your form offers before going live.
			You can test as long as you wish, and you can find all <strong>PayPal transactions</strong> and <strong>PayPal subscriptions</strong> within  your dashboard under the <strong>Super Forms</strong> menu:
		</p>
		<img src="assets/readme/images/paypal-menu.png" />
		
		<p>
			<strong>PayPal Transactions:</strong>
		</p>
		<a href="assets/readme/images/transactions.png" target="_blank"><img src="assets/readme/images/transactions.png" /></a>

		<p>
			<strong>PayPal Subscriptions:</strong>
		</p>
		<a href="assets/readme/images/subscriptions.png" target="_blank"><img src="assets/readme/images/subscriptions.png" /></a>

		<hr>
		
		<h3 id="example-forms"><strong>Example Forms</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>
			Example forms can be found under <strong>Super Forms > Marketplace</strong> within your wordpress dashboard.
			All form examples (including paypal add-on specific form examples) can be found over there, and can be installed with one mouse click.
