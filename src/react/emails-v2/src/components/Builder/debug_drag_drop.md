# Drag and Drop Debug Guide

## Issue Found and Fixed
The main issue was in `CanvasIntegrated.jsx` line 107:
```javascript
// OLD - This was hiding DropZones in empty email containers!
(parentId && parentId.includes('email-container') && position > 0 && elementCount === 0)
```

## Fix Applied
**Removed the problematic DropZone hiding logic** that prevented dropping elements into empty email containers.

## How to Test the Fix

### 1. Load Email Builder
- Open email builder in development mode
- Verify you see the email wrapper (outer container) and email container (inner 600px area)

### 2. Test Drag and Drop
- **Drag any element** (Text, Button, Image, etc.) from the palette at the bottom
- **Drop it into the email container** (the white 600px area in the center)
- **Expected Result**: Element should be successfully added to the container

### 3. Debugging Data Attributes
When inspecting elements in browser dev tools, look for:
- `data-component="DropZone"`
- `data-parent-id="email-container-[timestamp]"`
- `data-should-hide="false"` (should be false for email container DropZones)

### 4. Console Debugging
If drag/drop still doesn't work, check browser console for:
- DnD Kit errors
- Missing element type definitions
- Hook execution errors

## Technical Details

### Root Cause
The `shouldHide` logic was too aggressive and hid DropZones that users need to interact with.

### Elements Involved
1. **EmailBuilderIntegrated** - Handles drag start/end events
2. **CanvasIntegrated** - Renders DropZones and manages drop targets
3. **EmailContainerElement** - The actual drop target area
4. **useEmailBuilder** - Manages element addition logic

### Data Flow
1. User starts dragging element from palette
2. DnD Kit tracks drag over DropZones
3. On drop, `handleDragEnd` calls `addElement(type, parentId, position)`
4. `addElement` routes elements to email container when parentId is null
5. Element is added to the container's children array
6. UI re-renders with new element

## Verification Steps
- ✅ Build compiles without errors
- ✅ DropZone hiding logic fixed
- ✅ Email container DropZones remain visible
- ✅ Drag handlers properly configured
- ⏳ Manual testing required to confirm functionality
