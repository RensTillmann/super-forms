	When you are happy with the final results of your form you are ready to publish your form on your website.<br />
	Before you do I would like to point out the "Preview" mode that allows you to quickly view the form to see how it would look like on the front-end.<br />
	It is located at the top right on the builder page and has 3 methods:
</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Desktop preview <img src="<?php echo $folder; ?>desktop.PNG" /></th>
		<th>Tablet preview <img src="<?php echo $folder; ?>tablet.PNG" /></th>
		<th>Mobile preview <img src="<?php echo $folder; ?>mobile.PNG" /></th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>How your form will look on desktops</td>
		<td>How your form will look on tablets e.g: iPad or Galaxy Tab</td>
		<td>How your form will look on mobile devices e.g: iPhone or Galaxy S7</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>
	<strong>Please note:</strong> the preview is just to show the layout and can not be used as an actual test for the device(s).
</p>
<p>
	Now you have done the finishing touch with the preview mode, you can grab the shortcode at the top left (next to the form title).<br />
	You can simply copy this shortcode and place it anywhere on your site where you would like the form to be displayed.<br />
	Generally you would place this on a page inside the content (text) of the page.<br />
	But if you wish you can also place it in a Text Widget to for instance put the form in the footer of your site or in a sidebar.<br />
</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<th>1. Copy shortcode:</a></th>
		<th>2. Paste in content of page:</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="<?php echo $folder; ?>2.3.1.PNG" /></td>
		<td><img src="<?php echo $folder; ?>2.3.2.PNG" /></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
			Select the shortcode and press CTRL+C on your keyboard to copy it to your clipboard.
		<td>
			Go to the page or Text widget you would like to display the form on, hit CTRL+V to paste the shortcode.
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>
	Upon completing above 2 steps, your form will now be generated on the page or place you put the shortcode on.
