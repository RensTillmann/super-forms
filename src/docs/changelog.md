    `my-custom-public-folder` _custom file upload directory outside wp-content directory (which is still publically accessible but will not store in Media Library)_
    `../my-custom-private-folder` _secure file uploads_

This gives you more power/control in case you need the same setting for all of your forms. These option will not actually replace or override the individual form setting in the database, but simply ignore them. This means you can simply revert back to whatever setting was previously used on the individual form. _In a future version we might add an option that allows including/excluding specific forms from being overridden based on their form ID_
