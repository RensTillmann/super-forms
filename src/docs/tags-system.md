## What are {tags}?

The tags system in **Super Forms** is a very simple but yet very powerfull feature that gives any form the **flexibility** you require.

A so called `{tag}` can retrieve the form data entered by a user **on the fly** for either later use in your emails, or to directly display it somewhere in your form to be displayed to the user itself.

A simple usecase would be to **summarize** the information entered by the user.

## How to use tags?

A tag is written with the so called curly braces `{}` with in between the curly braces the [unique field name](unique-field-name) of the element you wish to retrieve the value from.

When you have a field name called `first_name` and you want to retrieve this value in your email body you can retrieve it by placing `{first_name}` in the body.

**Example:**

    Dear {first_name} {last_name},
    ...

**Above will translate to:**

    Dear John Doe,
    ...

With checkboxes, radio buttons and dropdowns this will work exactly the same way except that you will also have the ability to retrieve the **label** instead of the **value**.

Let's say you added a checkbox element with the following options:

* My fav color is red | Red
* My fav color is green | Green
* My fav color is orange | Orange

The left side is your option `label` and on the right your `value`.

If you would call your checkbox `fav_color` then you would retrieve the selected option values with the tag `{fav_color}`. But if you want to retrieve the label you can use `{fav_color;label}`.

**Example:**

    Selected color(s): {fav_color}
    Selected color(s): {fav_color;label}

    ...

**Above will translate to:**

    Selected color(s): Orange
    Selected color(s): My fav color is orange
    ...

## Advanced tags

### Setting and retrieving multiple values per options

Another feature you have with checkboxes, radio buttons and dropdowns is to **save multiple values** per value. In order to do this the only thing you will have to do is **seperate each value** per option with a semicolon `;`.

For instance, when you sell multiple packages based on a specific membership, you might need a different price per membership. Let's say we have a **Standard membership** and a **Gold membership**. We will ask the user to select a package. We will use a dropdown field so the user can select the according membership.

The dropdown will be named `membership` and will have 2 items with Label / Value:

* `Standard` / `standard;10`
* `Gold` / `gold;25`

Now whenever the user has selected an item from the dropdown, we can retrieve the correct price depending on their membership.

* To retrieve the **Standard membership** price we would use the tag `{membership;2}` wich would return `10`
* To retrieve the **Gold membership** price we would also use the tag `{membership;2}` wich would return `25`

Now you might ask where should I actually place this tag? You can choose to use it in one of the following locations/functions:

* Inside a HTML element (to display it to the user in for instance a summary)
* Inside [Conditional logic](conditional-logic)
* Inside [Variable fields](variable-fields)
* Inside any of the **Form Settings**, think of setting a custom **Contact Entry Title**, or defining a custom **Subject** for your emails or perhaps inside the email body itself

## Regular expressions

?> Because this feature is especially useful in combination with the **Calculator** Add-on, you can read about using regular expressions within tags here: [Calculation examples](calculator-add-on?id=calculation-examples)

## When and where can I use tags?

* Inside your E-mail bodies, Subjects, and all other email headers you could think of.
* In combination with [E-mail if statements](email-if-statements)
* Within your [HTML elements](html)
* Inside the Success Message that is displayed to the user after a successfull submitted form
* In combination with [Variable fields](variable-fields) and also within the conditional logic statements
* When redirecting form to a custom URL to add dynamic parameters e.g: domain.com/?first-name={first_name}&last-name={last_name}
* In validation option for text fields to conditionally check for same value as other field (to compare two field values)
* You can use tags when saving contact entries with a custom title
