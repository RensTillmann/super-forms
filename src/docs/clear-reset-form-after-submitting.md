# Clear/reset form after submitting

In case a form needs to be filled out multiple times after eachother with other data without the need to refresh the page, you can enable the option to clear/reset the form to it's initial state.

When enabled, each time the form is submitted, the form will reset itself with all of it's fields set to their default values.

To enable this feature go to `Form Settings > Form Settings` and enable **Clear / reset the form after submitting**.

**Reset/clear Button:**

The [Button element](button) also has the option to clear/reset the form to it's original state in case you want the user to start all over.
