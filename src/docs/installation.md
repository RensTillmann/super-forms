# Installing Super Forms

Below we will guide you through the steps to install the plugin on your WordPress website.

## Download the plugin

If you haven't already, download the [latest version](https://f4d.nl/super-forms/) of Super Forms and save it somewhere so you know where to find it later. You should now have the installable plugin named **super-forms.zip**.

## Upload the plugin

Within your WordPress dashboard go to `Plugins` > `Add New` > `Upload Plugins`.<br />
Now click on `Browse file` and search on your local computer for the **super-forms.zip** file you just downloaded.<br />
After you have selected the **.zip** file you can click on `Install Now`.<br />
WordPress will now start uploading the plugin files and install it on your site.

## Activating the plugin

After Wordpress finishes uploading the files, you will have to activate the plugin.<br />
You can simply do this by clicking on the `Activate plugin` link after the upload completed.<br />
You should now see a new menu item called `Super Forms`.<br />
If you do not see this menu item, confirm you have followed above steps correctly.
