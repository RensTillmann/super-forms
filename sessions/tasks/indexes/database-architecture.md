# Database & Architecture

## Active Tasks

### High Priority
- `h-research-eav-migration-complete.md` - Comprehensive research for migrating contact entry storage from serialized format to EAV table structure for 10-20x performance improvement
- `h-implement-eav-contact-entry-storage/` - Implement EAV storage migration with backwards compatibility, 30-60x performance improvement, and zero-downtime migration strategy
- `h-implement-developer-tools-page.md` - Developer tools page for EAV migration testing with automated verification, performance benchmarks, and test data generation
- `h-test-migration-and-devtools-page.md` - Collaborative testing and validation of migration system and Developer Tools page functionality, data integrity, and performance
- `h-test-eav-migration-real-data.md` - Test EAV migration with real production data using CSV/XML imports via Developer Tools page
- `h-implement-automatic-background-migration/` - Automatic frictionless background migration using Action Scheduler with per-entry verification, self-healing, and zero user intervention

### Medium Priority
- `m-refactor-eav-migration-status-cache.md` - Cache EAV migration status to eliminate redundant get_option() calls across multiple methods

### Low Priority

### Investigate
