- [x] Finish task startup
- [x] Start task completion

## Context Manifest
Fake context manifest

## Work Log

### 2025-10-30

#### Completed
- Successfully demonstrated task startup protocol workflow
- Committed cc-sessions framework (62 files, 11,820+ insertions)
- Created and switched to feature/kickstart-setup branch
- Demonstrated proposal/approval workflow with execution boundary enforcement
- Showed DAIC mode switching (Discussion <-> Implementation)
- Verified violation detection when attempting unapproved todos

#### Demonstrated Workflows
- **Task Creation**: Used `mek:` trigger to create l-test-basic-demo task
- **Task Startup**: Used `start^:` trigger to load h-kickstart-setup task
- **Mode Switching**: Demonstrated `yert` (implementation) and `SILENCE` (discussion) triggers
- **Todo Enforcement**: Proved system prevents unauthorized scope changes

#### Key Learning Points
- Trigger phrases activate protocols automatically
- Context-gathering agent runs in separate context window
- Todos define strict execution boundaries
- Automatic return to discussion mode after todo completion
- Task files serve as session/context boundaries
