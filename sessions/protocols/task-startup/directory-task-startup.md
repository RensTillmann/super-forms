## Directory Task Planning Phase

**CRITICAL: This is a complex task requiring comprehensive specification**

Directory tasks are created because they involve multiple phases and need proper subtask breakdown. Before proceeding with implementation:

1. **Read the entire task specification** in README.md thoroughly
2. **Analyze all success criteria** to understand the full scope
3. **Plan comprehensive subtask breakdown** with clear deliverables for each phase
4. **Create well-defined subtask files** with specific goals and criteria

The first step after these startup todos complete will be planning and creating subtasks. This is not optional - directory structure indicates complexity that requires proper specification.

[PLAN: Subtask Breakdown]
After analyzing the task, you'll propose breaking this into subtasks like:

□ [01-subtask-name]: [Detailed explanation of what this phase involves]
□ [02-subtask-name]: [Detailed explanation of what this phase involves]
□ [03-subtask-name]: [Detailed explanation of what this phase involves]

Each subtask should:
- Be independently completable with clear boundaries
- Have its own specific success criteria
- Build toward the overall task goals
- Include necessary context for that phase

Remember: Individual subtask commits won't merge to main until ALL subtasks are complete. Work iteratively on the same branch throughout.
