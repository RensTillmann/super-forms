### Step 2: Stage All Changes

**⚠️ CRITICAL: ALWAYS STAGE ALL CHANGES ⚠️**

Use `git add -A` to stage ALL changes including:
- Modified files
- New files  
- Deleted files
- Submodule reference updates

**NEVER** selectively stage files - every change on the task branch is part of the complete implementation.
