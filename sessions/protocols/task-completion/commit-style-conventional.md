Use branch-prefix format for your commit message:
- Format: `branch-prefix: brief description`
- The branch prefix comes from your current branch (feature, fix, refactor, etc.)
- Keep description under 50 characters, lowercase
- Examples:
  - `feature: add protocol startup-load command`
  - `fix: remove unnecessary repository check`
  - `refactor: simplify task creation todos`
