## Directory Task Completion Check

**IMPORTANT: This is the parent task for a directory with multiple subtasks**

Before completing this directory task:

1. **Verify ALL subtasks are complete**
   - Check the README.md subtask tracking section
   - Ensure each subtask file shows completed status
   - Confirm no pending work remains in any subtask

2. **Review overall success criteria**
   - Return to the main README.md file
   - Verify that ALL success criteria for the entire task are satisfied
   - The sum of subtask completions should fulfill the main task goals

3. **Commit and merge**
   - Commit final changes to the task branch
   - Merge to {default_branch} (unless user says otherwise)
   - All subtask work is complete and ready to integrate
