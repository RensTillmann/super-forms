## About

With this feature you can `register` or `login` users through your Super Forms.

You can also choose to only allow specific user role(s) to login. And specify what role a new registered user should get. Of course the Lost password form is also available which allows users to enter their email address to receive a new password. As an option you can select to send an verification email after registration or instantly let users login after their registration. Redirect to any page (for instance a dashboard).

## Quick start

The following actions are available:

* Register a new user
* Login (user will be logged in)
* Reset password (lost password)
* Update current logged in user

The quickest way to get started is to install the Demo forms available under `Super Forms > Demos`. Here you can find the demo forms:

* Register Form
* Login Form
* Lost Password Form

### Creating a login form

?> **NOTE:** Demo form available under `Super Forms > Demos` named `Login Form`

Edit your form and navigate to `Form Settings > Register & Login`.

From the `Actions` option choose `Login (user will be logged in)`.

Now select the roles that are allowed to login, or leave black to allow all roles.

Define the URL where the login page is located on your site.

In case you enable the option to send an verification email to the user, you must make sure you added the `Activation Code` element to your login form. This is where the user will enter the verification code to verify their account.

!> **Important:** Your form must have a password field exactly named `user_pass` or the user won't be able to login. Also make sure to exclude the password field from being saved in Contact Entries, and Exclude it from E-mails. There is no need to send the password, and it can only cause a security risk. However Super Forms gives you this possibility, you are free to do with the data as you please.

?> **Note:** Your form should also contain a field named `user_login` or `user_email` or the user won't be able to login.

It is also important to setup the correct `Login page URL` or the user wouldn't be redirected to the login form correctly through the tag `{register_login_url}`.

It is also possible to manually approve registrations. If this is the case you will want to change the `User login status after registration` from `Active (default)` to `Pending`. Please understand that this isn't the same thing as the email verification.
