## Quick start

To use this you must have an account at [zapier.com](zapier.com)

Once registered you can create your first Super Forms Zap via the below Invitation Link:

Follow the steps provided at Zapier, and once asked for a test submission make sure to setup the Zapier webhook URL on your form by navigating to: `Form Settings > Zapier Settings`.

Make sure to check `Enable Zapier connection` and to enter the webhook under `Zapier webhook URL`.

Now test your Zap by submitting the form. When everything was setup correctly Zapier should tell you so.

Now you should be able to connect the form with many different applications!
