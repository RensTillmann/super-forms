## Description

Do you need a form in multiple languages? No problem with Super Forms!

Easily translate the forms you already build with a native build in translation system.

The only thing you will have to do is choose your default language and sub languages.

Easily enable `RTL` so that Super Forms will automatically apply the `Right to left` layout.

Both `Elements Settings` and `Form Settings` can be translated, so that you can send emails in the correct language.

Enable the `Language Switcher` so that your users can easily switch to their preferred languages on the fly or choose to display a fixed language with the use of shortcodes:

```html
[super_form i18n="en_GB" id="49515"]
[super_form i18n="nl_NL" id="49515"]
[super_form i18n="de_DE" id="49515"]
```
