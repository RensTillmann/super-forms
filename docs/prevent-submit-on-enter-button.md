# Prevent submitting form on pressing "Enter" keyboard button

In some circumstances you might not wish to let the user submit the form when they hit "Enter" on their keyboard.

In this case you can go to `Form Settings > Form Settings` and enable the option **Prevent submitting form on pressing "Enter" keyboard button**.

When enabled, the form will no longer submit itself when the user pressed the "Enter" button on their keyboard.
