      Is it compatible with Visual Composer?
  </summary>

  Super Forms has it's own Visual Composer (JS Composer) element.

  With this element you can simply **Drag & Drop** any form at a specific location in your page.
  After you dropped the element you can choose which form it should load simply with the use of a dropdown that will list all the forms you have created.

  The Super Forms [shortcode] can also be inserted into a Visual Composer **HTML element**. This makes it easy to insert it into any area within your Visual Composer pages.</details>
